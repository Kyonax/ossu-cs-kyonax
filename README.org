- OSSU Definition ::
  OSSU is a *Open Source Society University* is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit with a mission of empowering learners to master college curricula through free resources.

- OSSU Computer Science Information ::
  *The OSSU curriculum* is a complete education in computer science using online materials. It's not merely for career training or professional development. It's for those who want a proper, well-rounded grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own, but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.  *More Information on: [[https://github.com/ossu/computer-science][OSSU Computer Science Github]]*

* Student Words
The Mission of this Repo is to save the progress that *Cristian Moreno* aka *Kyonax* will have being in the *OSSU of Computer Science program*, to learn the basics to start the enrollment into a College and Study a Computer Science Degree.

- *Start Day: 2023/MAY/08* | Starting the Intro CS Stage

I'll divide the study program on Stages of *20h/week* Courses, the idea is to follow all the instructions from the OSSU Repo and put them into practice, the first stage of this *OSSU CS Program* is the *1st Stage - Intro to Computer Science*.

** 1st Stage - Intro CS

| Course Name                                                 | Stage                | Duration | Effort   | Requierements       |

*The study plan for this Stage has a constancy of *25h/week* of Study - with the Goal of Finalizing on 2023/07/29

*** 1st Stage Documentation & Projects
